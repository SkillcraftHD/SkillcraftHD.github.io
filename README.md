## Why Open Source?
Since I believe that development should be as transparent as possible, I'm making every project's code open source, meaning you can read, copy, and use the code for your own purposes. This can both help people understand how I made the projects and maybe learn something from my code, as well as use the code for their own projects in order to speed up their development. However, don't forget that the code is still under the MIT license, more info in the [LICENSE file](LICENSE).
